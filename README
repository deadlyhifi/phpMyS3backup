== What is phpMyS3backup? ==
phpMyS3backup is a PHP based tool that will backup a MySQL server to Amazon's
S3 service (http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). The tool requires php5-cli
and mysqldump, it also uses the AWS SDK for PHP (
https://github.com/amazonwebservices/aws-sdk-for-php ) which is included.

== How to use? ==
* Grab a copy of the latest code: git://github.com/deadlyhifi/phpMyS3backup.git
* Fill in your connection credentials in phpMyS3backup.php
* Execute `php phpMyS3backup.php` and wait
* When you get dropped back to the command line, check your S3
* Done!

* Set it running with a cron job and rest easy as your databases are backed up while you sit with your feet up sipping coffee.
* If you want backups to auto delete after a given time period then visit your S3 management console
	* https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home
	* Enter your backup bucket
	* Click 'Properties'
	* Click 'Lifecycle'
	* Enter a name (e.g. `mysql backup expiration`)
	* Under prefix enter 'mysql_backups' (or whatever you have set BACKUP_FOLDER to)
	* Enter expiration time (e.g. 30 days)

== How it works? ==
Here's the short version of what this tool does:
* Get's a list of all your databases (except `information_schema`)
* mysqldump each database to it's own file
* gzip's each dump file
* Upload all files to your defined S3 bucket
** All files are stored with:
*** Reduced Redundancy Storage
*** AES256 Encryption
*** "Private" permissions (no sharing)
* Delete the local backups
